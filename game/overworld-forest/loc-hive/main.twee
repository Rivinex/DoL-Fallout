	You follow the <<beastsplural>> to a large willow tree. They tell you to start stripping bark for use for new nets. You spend the day stripping bark and throwing it inside a basket before returning to the hive.

:: Hive Animal Hunting Architect Agree
“Sure I’d be happy to help.” You agree. “Great come this way.” <<bHe>> beckons you deeper into the Hive and into the barracks. “So your job is to build some new pods for when the young ones develop enough.” <<bHe>> informs you. “Just use these wax panels. They’ve already been cut into the proper sizes so just stick them together in the right shape to form the pod.” <<bHe>> turns <<bhis>> back and leaves.

	You start sliding the wax plates into place. It’s quite easy and you finish your job rather quickly.

<<else>>
	You start sticking the wax plates together but you can’t quite figure out the proper way to slot them together. You continue struggling until evening. The other <<beasttype>> watch you and start to laugh watching you fail repeatedly. Eventually you manage to get the pod built.<<gstress>><<stress +3>>

<<set $TaylorFreed to 1>>
You vouch for Taylor's good intentions and that <<he>> didn’t mean anything bad and was just curious. She thinks for a moment “If we let <<him>> out and <<he>> ever returns <<he>> will not be given another chance. Since you two are close you should be the one to let <<him>> out.” She says tossing you the cell key. “That was all, find your way out.” You make your way out and back to the cells.
<br><br>
You find Taylor and <<he>> greets you. “You’re back, welcome. Wait what’s that?” <<he>> asks. You tell <<him>> you managed to convince the queens to release <<him>> if <<he>> never came near the hive again. “Oh that’s easy, after this experience I wouldn’t have even if I could. Listen I live on Danube Street, maybe pay me a visit sometime.” <<he>> says as <<he>> steps out of the cell and you guide <<him>> to the entrance watching <<him>> leave.
