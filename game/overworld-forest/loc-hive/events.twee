<<addinlineevent "observe_enemyhive">>
    <<beastNEWinit 3 wasp>>
    A small group of <<beastsplural>> from another hive approach the entrance to the hive you’re observing, before being stopped by the hive guards. 
    <br><br>

    A fight breaks out before the foreign <<beastsplural>> flee from the area. This experience makes you reflect on the hive's territorial behaviors.

<<addinlineevent "observe_queen">>
    You catch a glimpse of the queen for a few moments before she disappears from sight. Just from the small fraction you’ve seen you can tell she's quite beautiful. You feel oddly compelled to serve.

    <<beastNEWinit 3 wasp>>
    A small group of <<beastsplural>> leave the hive carrying crude spears. You watch them enter the woods and trail a bit behind to avoid notice. The <<beastsplural>> stop and wait for a moment.

    <<beastNEWinit 3 bee>>
    You follow a small group of <<beastsplural>> into a small clearing in the forest. The clearing is full of beautiful flowers. 
    <br><br>
    
    You watch the <<beastsplural>> start collecting pollen from them carefully making sure to stay hidden. Upon collecting as much as possible they return to the hive. 
    <br><br>
    
    The <<beastsplural>> dedication to keeping the hive fed makes you feel warm inside.

:: Hive Wasp Continue
<<set $outside to 1>><<set $location to "hive">><<effects>>

The <<beastsplural>> sits quietly listening before continuing onwards. They stop by the lake and sit in the grasses. After a while a large boar stumbles through the woods into the clearing. 
<br><br>

The <<beastsplural>> swiftly catch and kill the boar before picking the body up together and carrying it back to the hive. Their expertise in hunting gives you a new understanding of their structure.

:: Hive Wasp Detect 
<<set $outside to 1>><<set $location to "hive">><<effects>>

The <<beastsplural>> sit quietly listening before continuing onwards. You continue following but lose track of them between the trees. You glance around and can see nothing out of place around you.
<br><br>

You start to leave but hear a noise. You quickly turn around and find yourself surrounded by the <<beastsplural>>.
