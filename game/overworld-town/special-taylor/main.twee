"It's not really your problem but my <<if $NPCName[$NPCNameList.indexOf("Taylor")].gender is "m">>son<<else>>daughter<</if>> Taylor has gone missing. She sniffles. <<He>> would never run away and I fear something's wrong. <<He>> usually goes out into the woods but <<he>> always comes back right away. Please find <<him>> for me." She starts to cry as she shuts the door.

:: Taylor Reason
“I was observing the hive. I was trying to gauge how developed the bees and wasps of the forest are. Humans don’t really come this far out so they’re a pretty big mystery to most people and I just couldn’t help myself. Oh yeah my name’s Taylor it’s a pleasure.”
<br><br>

“Actually I was wondering when I could get out of here. I was told it would be up to the queens but I don't know how long that will take. Could you maybe talk to them sometime for me?”
