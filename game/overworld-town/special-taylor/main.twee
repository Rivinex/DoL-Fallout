:: Taylor Reason
“I was observing the hive. I was trying to gauge how developed the bees and wasps of the forest are. Humans don’t really come this far out so they’re a pretty big mystery to most people and I just couldn’t help myself. Oh yeah my name’s Taylor it’s a pleasure.”
<br><br>

“Actually I was wondering when I could get out of here. I was told it would be up to the queens but I don't know how long that will take. Could you maybe talk to them sometime for me?”

	You pick up a small green restored book that smells quite old. You flip through the pages and it talks about an ancient temple built deep inside of an old cave. Apparently the temple is guarded by a large stone monster so exploration is not advised.

	You pick up a small purple restored book and start flipping through the pages. It speaks of an old temple underneath the local forest lake. Not much is known about this ruin making exploration unadvised. Explore with caution.

	<<set $TaylorReadMansion to 1>>
	A large purple book lies on the desk. You open it and read about a large abandoned manor. The manor is next to a large graveyard and hasn’t been occupied for centuries. Stories passed down in town say the mansions haunted and most folk stay away fearing what may be within. Given the rumors the place may be quite dangerous. Explore with caution.

	We better go buy some gear first come with me.” Taylor leads you through the mall into a large shop full of miscellaneous gear and items. <<He>> comes out a moment later with two wetsuits, tanks, masks, and fins. “God I wish I had a car to carry all this stuff in.” <<He>> wheezes exhausted. “Could you maybe help me carry these to the lake?” <<He>> asks.
<<else>>
	You help Taylor carry the equipment though the forest and to the lake without issue. The two of you reach the lakeside and lay the equipment on the sand and take a break. You sit together on the shore for a few minutes before you continue getting ready.
